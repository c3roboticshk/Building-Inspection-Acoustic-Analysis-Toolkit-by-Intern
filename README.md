## Core Modules

### 1. Audio Processing (`single_test.py`, `plot.py`)
- Detects knocking sounds in WAV files
- Extracts acoustic features:
  - Duration, RMS energy, peak amplitude
  - Decay time, spectral centroid
  - Frequency ratios (low/mid/high)
  - Dominant frequency
- Visualizes waveforms and spectra
- Two features stand out in detection purpose: rms energy and middle frequency ratio (500Hz - 1100Hz), other features still need varify
- in analyze_knocks: Decay time is excluded due because data accuracy is difficult to graspÔºåthreshold coefficient can be modified to get proper decay time to separate defect voices
  ```python
  Decay time (time for amplitude to drop to 10% of peak)
        peak_amplitude = np.max(np.abs(knock_segment))
        threshold = 0.2 * peak_amplitude
        above_threshold = np.where(np.abs(knock_segment) > threshold)[0]
        if len(above_threshold) > 0:
            decay_time = (above_threshold[-1] - above_threshold[0]) / sample_rate
        else:
            decay_time = 0
  
- in analyze_knocks: increase height to exclude noise or decrease to include faint knocking
   ```python
  # Find the knocking sounds (peaks in amplitude)
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(np.abs(audio_data), height=0.05, distance=sample_rate * 0.5)

### 2. Clustering Analysis (`folder_test.py`, `folder_test_with_n.py`)
- Processes folders of WAV files
- Performs clustering using:
  - KMeans
  - DBSCAN
  - Spectral Clustering
- Generates:
  - Cluster heatmaps (`plot.png`)
  - Feature scatter plots (`dim.png`)
  - Cluster distribution reports

### 3. Building Projection (`attach.py`)
- Projects wall analysis results onto building blueprint
- Uses perspective transformation
- Handles multiple wall segments with custom coordinates
- Outputs final building image (`projected_building.jpg`)

### 4. Advanced Feature Extraction (`*_with_n.py`)
- Uses autoencoder for dimensionality reduction
- 8-layer neural network architecture
- Latent space feature extraction
- Improved clustering separation

## Usage Workflow

1. **Collect Data**:
   - Record knocking sounds on building surfaces
   - Organize WAV files by wall section (e.g., `/West/west_s1(19)/001.wav--163.wav`)

2. **Analyze Single Wall**:

    in folder_test.py or folder_test_with_n.py:
    in main:
   - Modify 
     ```python
     wav_folder = "/path/to/wall/section"
     
   - Choose cluster methodÔºö  
     ```python
     df_all = pd.DataFrame(all_features)
     feature_cols = ['rms_energy','mid_freq_ratio']
     .... 
     labels, best_n = perform_clustering(X_scaled,method='dbscan' or 'KMeans' or 'spectral' or 'gmm')
     
   - Input image of the building:
     ```python
     building_img = cv2.imread('/path/to/building_blueprint.jpg')
     
   - Define projected area: 
     ```python
     building_corners = np.array([[upper left], [upper right], [lower right], [lower left]], dtype=np.float32)
     
   - Results are shown in dim.png (features layout), dex.png (projected wall), plot.png (heatmap result)
   
    ```bash
   python folder_test_with_n.py
   python folder_test.py
   
   
   

3. **Full Building Analysis**: 

    in test.py or test_with_n.py:
    in main:
   - Modify:
     ```python
     wav_folder = "/path/to/wall"
     
   - Choose cluster methodÔºö  
     ```python
     df_all = pd.DataFrame(all_features)
     feature_cols = ['rms_energy','mid_freq_ratio']
     .... 
     labels, best_n = perform_clustering(X_scaled,method='dbscan' or 'KMeans' or 'gmm')  'spectral' dose not apply

   - Results are shown in dim.png (features layout), result.png (heatmap result)
   
    ```bash
   python test_with_n.py
   python test.py
   
4. **Project Results (only after Full Building Analysis)**: 
    
    in attach.py:
    
    - modifyÔºö  
      ```python
      BASE_PATH = "/path/to/building/sections/"
      BG_PATH = "/path/to/building_blueprint.jpg"
      WALL_COORDINATES = {
      "wall_section1": np.array([[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ...]),
      ...
      }
    - Results are shown in projected_building.jpg
   ```bash
    python attach.py
   
5. **Audio analysis**: 
    
    in single_test.py:
    
    - modifyÔºö  
      ```python
       # Replace with your WAV file path
       wav_file_path = (
        '/Users/ywsun/Desktop/pythonProject/C3/audio_samples/audio/no_fan_pc_usbc.wav')
       knock_save_dir = "/Users/ywsun/Desktop/pythonProject/C3/audio_samples/audio/cut/5/"
       # Analyze the WAV file and save knock segments
       results, sample_rate, audio_data, peaks = analyze_knocks(wav_file_path, save_dir=None)
       # Plot and display results
       plot_results(results, sample_rate, audio_data, peaks)
    
   ```bash
    python single_test.py

3. **Possible Denoise Strategy**



`timedff.py`
A program that performs time-delay estimation and voice activity detection (VAD) on two audio signals recorded by two microphones. The program uses the cross-correlation method to estimate the time delay between the two signals, and then filters out events with a time delay less than a specified threshold.

The main features of `timedff.py` include:

1. **Voice Activity Detection**: The program uses a dynamic threshold based on the signal energy envelope to detect active speech segments in the audio.
2. **Time Delay Estimation**: The program calculates the time delay between the two microphone signals using cross-correlation, and filters out events with a delay less than a specified threshold.
3. **Configurable Parameters**: The program allows you to configure various parameters, such as the microphone distance, time delay threshold, and VAD threshold.

`cut_freq.py`
A program that removes a specific frequency range from an audio signal. The program uses a Butterworth bandpass filter to remove the specified frequency range.

The main features of `cut_freq.py` include:

1. **Frequency Removal**: The program can remove a specific frequency range from an audio signal, preserving the rest of the audio.
2. **Configurable Frequency Range**: The program allows you to specify the lower and upper cutoff frequencies for the bandpass filter.
3. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling to gracefully handle invalid input files or filter parameters.



4. **Audio Samples**
    Some audio samples with different wall condition and fan level
